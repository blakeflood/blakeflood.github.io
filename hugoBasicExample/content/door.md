There are a few ways you can improve insulation with a new door:

Choose a door with a high R-value: The R-value is a measure of a door's insulation properties. A door with a high R-value will provide better insulation than one with a lower R-value.

Choose a door with a good seal: A door with a good seal will help prevent drafts and reduce heat loss. Look for a door with a weatherstrip or other sealing mechanism to help seal the gap between the door and the door frame.

Choose a door with a thermal break: A thermal break is a layer of insulation that helps prevent heat transfer between the inside and outside of the door. Doors with thermal breaks can provide better insulation than those without.

Install the door correctly: Proper installation is important to ensure that the door provides good insulation. Make sure the door is properly sealed and that the weatherstripping is in good condition.

By following these steps, you can improve the insulation of your home and make it more energy efficient.
