The frequency with which you should replace the insulation in your home will depend on several factors, including the type of insulation, the condition of the insulation, and the age of the insulation.

In general, insulation can last for many years, but it may need to be replaced if it has become damaged or if it is no longer effective at insulating your home. Some signs that you may need to replace your insulation include:

Your energy bills are higher than normal.

Your home is drafty or uncomfortable.

The insulation is visibly damaged or has been contaminated with water or pests.

The insulation is more than 15 years old.

If you are unsure whether your insulation needs to be replaced, you can hire a professional energy auditor to assess the condition of your insulation and recommend any necessary repairs or replacements. They can also recommend the type and amount of insulation that would be most effective for your home.
